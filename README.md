- About me:
  Hello! I am a 3rd Year Computer Science student deeply passionate about back-end software engineering, with a specific focus on machine learning, algorithms, and the intricacies of training AI models. As far back as my memory brings me, I've nurtured a profound love for computers. Aspiring to become a backend engineer, I bring dedication and hands-on experience in software testing and development to the table. Beyond coding, I find joy in an active lifestyle, whether it's strength training or backpacking through national parks. A goal-oriented and communicative individual, I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute to impactful projects in the dynamic tech landscape.
