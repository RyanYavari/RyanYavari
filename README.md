* Currently open to Software Engineering Internships for Summer 2024*


- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RyanYavari
  
- About me: Aspiring to make a mark in the world of software engineering, I am passionate about programming with a specific focus on artificial intelligence. My journey started in the 7th grade with my first Java class, and ever since, I've nurtured a deep love for computers. With a keen interest in becoming a full-time software backend engineer, I bring dedication and enthusiasm to the world of AI. Beyond coding, I find joy in staying active at the gym and exploring the outdoors, with a particular love for backpacking in national parks.
